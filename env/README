== Scripts in this directory =

I have prepared several scripts to run the various functions that may be needed
to work this project.

These scripts expect that they will be run from the env/ directory and that the
env/ directory will exist in the base of the project directory with `leiningen`,
the java compiler and java runtime installed and setup.

They also expect a resources/ folder in the base of the env/ directory
containing the antlr.jar and JSHOP2.jar files.

1. scripts/build.sh

The build script will build the project and transfer the new version of the .jar
file generated into the env/ folder ready for `run`ing.

2. scripts/run.sh

The run script will run the .jar file and output it's output to the console.

3. scripts/clean.sh

If the .jar file errors then intermediate files can sometimes be failed to be
cleaned up, this script will delete these files as well as the domain extension
and problem files.
